 *   never does Ã¢ÂÂ 4 s separates the two without a visible false-positive
 *   window.
 * - `RC_SIGNALING_TIMEOUT_MS`: max time in `'negotiating'` before the
 *   attempt is abandoned and the ladder advances. ICE legitimately
 *   varies by network here (a corp-VPN host reaching a DERP relay is
 *   nothing like a LAN pair), so this stays generous.
 * - `RC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (FR-22): the same bound applied to
 *   `'requesting'`, which is a different question - *did the server
 *   answer at all?* That is one hop, measured sub-second across ten
 *   consecutive sessions, so guarding it with the ICE-sized number meant
 *   a lost request cost 15 s before the 250 ms ladder retried and
 *   succeeded on the normal ~3 s path: about 18 s total, which is
 *   exactly the "sometimes 10-15 seconds" the operator reported. The bad
 *   case is now ~7 s; the good case is untouched.
 *   `awaiting_consent` is exempt from both - the SERVER owns that
 *   timeout (consent_timeout), and a human on a Prompt-mode org device
 *   may legitimately take longer than any client-side number.
 * - Watchdog: ticks every `RC_WATCHDOG_TICK_MS` while connected. After
 *   `RC_STALL_PROBE_TICKS` ticks with zero media progress it sends ONE
 *   `rc:keyframe` probe Ã¢ÂÂ a static remote desktop legitimately produces
 *   no frames, so flat counters alone must NOT trigger a reconnect; a
 *   live agent answers the probe with an IDR within a tick. Only if the

 *     takes that flag as input rather than re-deriving it
 *     (regression bug 2026-05-09: dbl-click `dev` after `C:\` shipped

 * when enabled the LEFT/RIGHT CONTROL usages (0xe0/0xe4) are rewritten

 * since 0.1.x, so every deployed agent understands it). This is the
 * same trade RustDesk/CRD/Parsec ship as "translate mode": Ctrl+C in a
 * remote mac Terminal becomes Cmd+C (copy) — the per-session toggle
 * restores literal Ctrl for terminal work.
 *
 * The release half is keyed on what was actually SENT, not on the
 * toggle's current value — flipping the toggle mid-hold must release
 * the key the host believes is down, or Cmd sticks.
