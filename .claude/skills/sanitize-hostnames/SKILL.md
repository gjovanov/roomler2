# Sanitising machine names

Field notes are written in the heat of debugging, and a debugging session
writes down the name of the machine it is debugging. That name is a corp asset
tag, or a Windows default hostname, or someone's computer named after them.
On a **public** repo those are reconnaissance value: they map the fleet and say
which host runs what.

This skill rewrites them to the display names the product itself shows, so the
narratives stay readable — "the corp laptop over the VPN" is still a useful
sentence — while the tags themselves are gone.

## The map lives OUTSIDE the repo

`C:\dev\gjovanov\sanitize-map.txt`

That path is deliberate and non-negotiable: the map is the one place a real
name and its replacement sit **side by side**, so committing it would publish
exactly what the sweep exists to remove. Never commit it, never quote it in a
commit message, never paste it into an issue or a PR.

**Every file in this directory is written tag-free on purpose, prose included.**
A sweep walks the repo and does not exempt its own tooling. The first version of
this document named real tags in its explanations and the sweep rewrote them
into nonsense; the second time round the Python docstrings did it, and a history
rewrite turned *"a three-letter shorthand like `<tag>`"* into a sentence naming
an alias, and *"`<old-alias>` → `<new-alias>`"* into `X → X`.

So: describe the RULES, never the instances. Check this directory against the
map after any sweep —

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/sanitize-hostnames/sanitize.py \
    --map <map> --root .claude/skills/sanitize-hostnames --check   # want 0 / none
```

⚠️ Note what survived both times: the regexes. `\bCLK…` has no word boundary
before the letters (the preceding `b` of `\b` is a word character), so patterns
are accidentally immune while the comments beside them are not. The tool keeps
working and only its explanation rots — which is the failure mode that lasts,
because nothing fails.

### Map format

```
real-name = replacement      # one pair per line, '#' starts a comment
!keep goran                  # a spelling that must survive verbatim
```

Matching is **case-sensitive, whole-word, literal** — so list every casing that
actually occurs. `!keep` declares a spelling that must never be rewritten *and*
must never be reported as residue; it is matched case-sensitively, because its
whole reason to exist is a token whose uppercase form is a hostname and whose
lowercase form is a profile directory and an email local part.

## Running it

```bash
R=/mnt/c/dev/gjovanov/roomler-ai; M=/mnt/c/dev/gjovanov/sanitize-map.txt
S=$R/.claude/skills/sanitize-hostnames

# 1. working tree
python3 $S/sanitize.py --map $M --root $R --apply     # or --check for CI

# 2. GitHub: issue + PR titles/bodies, comments, release notes
python3 $S/sanitize_github.py --map $M --apply        # or --check

# 2b. GitHub by SHAPE, which step 2 cannot do. sanitize_github.py is
#     map-driven, so it finds only names somebody already listed; nothing
#     otherwise scans PUBLISHED content for the *class*. Dump the bodies and
#     point check_shapes.py at them. (2026-09-06: 60k lines of issues, PRs,
#     comments and releases — clean.)

### When step 2b reports a canary

Writing this guard up publishes its canaries: the write-up quotes the guard's own
output, and step 2b then scans that write-up. The hit is real, benign, and
recurs on every run — which is how a check earns the noise that gets it deleted.

**Do not silence it by allowlisting a value that is still in `CAUGHT`.** That
makes the canary vacuous, which is the one failure this whole directory exists
to prevent, and `selftest.sh` refuses it immediately (`MISSED:`, both casings).

Rotate instead, and move the retired value into **both** `ALLOW` and `IGNORED` —
the allowlist entry is the exemption, the `IGNORED` entry is what asserts the
exemption still works. Either alone rots: an entry with no assertion is an
unguarded hole, an assertion with no entry fails the selftest. Confirm-RED both
halves (break the entry ⇒ `FALSE POSITIVE`; plant the fresh value ⇒ it is named).

⚠️ Rotation costs one canary value per write-up, so it does not scale. If it
happens a second time, filter the dump at this boundary instead — the noise is
in published content, and paying for it out of a shared allowlist buys read-quiet
with a hole in the repo scan and CI too.

## Three layers, and only the first one is cheap

| layer | stops it at | enable |
|---|---|---|
| `.githooks/pre-commit` | the commit | `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` |
| CI job **No real machine names** | the merge | required status check on `master` |
| the sweep below | after publication | run it by hand |

Layer 3 has run three times now. Each run force-pushes ~700 branches and ~660
tags with GitHub Actions disabled around it, and it still **cannot remove
anything from GitHub** — the pre-rewrite commits stay reachable by SHA through
`refs/pull/*` until GitHub Support runs GC. Treat every sweep as damage
control, and the hook as the actual fix.

⚠️ **Set `core.hooksPath` in every clone.** It is per-clone config, so a fresh
clone has no hook until someone runs that line. Worktrees **share** that config
and the hook is tracked, so setting it once in the clone covers every worktree
made from it — but a worktree on a branch predating the hook still has no file,
which is the harmless `tool absent -- do not block` path.

## The other kind of name: WHO, not WHICH MACHINE

Everything above is about **content** — a hostname inside a file or a commit
message. A second surface leaks a name without touching content at all, and
this skill's guards are structurally blind to it:

| surface | what leaks | guarded by |
|---|---|---|
| a blob or a commit message | which machine | `check_shapes.py` + the sweep |
| a commit's author / committer | **who**, as an email address | `.githooks/check-identity.sh` |
| a GitHub issue, comment, review, release | **who**, as an account login | `.claude/hooks/gh-account-guard.sh` |

Rows 2 and 3 arrived on 2026-09-05, after an audit found a second GitHub
account — a corp one, whose *login alone* named an employer — had authored one
issue and three comments on this public repo, across three days spanning
eleven. It had authored no commits, and that was luck: nothing checked. In the
same history sat 520 commits carrying a corp mailbox as their author address.

Three things are worth carrying over from that:

- **A commit identity is metadata**, so it is in no blob and no message. The
  shape scan walks straight past it, and always would have.
- **`gh auth switch` is global.** It rewrites the active account in a shared
  config, for every process and every concurrent session. A second account
  signed in for unrelated work is one command away from authoring things, and
  `gh issue comment` prints a URL rather than an identity — so the mistake is
  invisible from inside the session making it. `scripts/gh-scoped-config.sh`
  builds a config directory the other account is not *in*, which is the
  difference between a rule that is checked and one that cannot be broken.
- **An ALLOWLIST, not a denylist**, and for the same reason the shape guard is
  shape-based: a denylist would have to write the unwanted addresses into a
  public file, publishing exactly what it exists to remove — and it only ever
  finds the mistakes someone already thought of. A denylist finds the
  identities you know about; an allowlist finds the class.

⚠️ **Neither is recoverable downstream**, which is why both are cheap only
here. A commit identity cannot be edited, only rewritten — renumbering every
SHA above it, and still leaving the old objects reachable through
`refs/pull/*`. An issue or comment author cannot be changed at all: the only
remedy is delete-and-recreate, which loses the thread and dangles every
reference to its number, including any already baked into a merged commit
subject.

⚠️ **One hole no local layer can close**: a merge made through the GitHub web
UI is committed *on GitHub*, from the email set on the **account**, after every
hook and PR check has already passed. Two things follow, and the second is the
one people get wrong:

1. **The fix is the account setting**, not a guard — GitHub Settings → Emails.
   Keep the address off the account, or turn on *Keep my email address private*
   so commits use the `users.noreply.github.com` form.
2. **A repository ruleset cannot help here.** `commit_author_email_pattern`
   would block it, but the whole metadata-rule family is organisation-and-paid-
   plan only: on this user-owned public repo the API refuses every one of
   `commit_author_email_pattern`, `committer_email_pattern`,
   `commit_message_pattern` and `branch_name_pattern` with HTTP 422 (measured
   2026-09-06, in `active` enforcement — `evaluate` is separately Enterprise-
   only). Do not plan around it.

What actually covers it is the **CI job's push-to-master run**: `on: push`
scans `github.event.before..github.sha`, so a merge commit with a foreign
identity turns master red within a minute. That is detection, not prevention —
the commit exists by then — but it is the difference between finding out in a
minute and finding out in an audit eleven days later, which is how this whole
entry started.

⚠️ Its fallback matters and was exercised on day one: after a force-push,
`github.event.before` names a commit that no longer exists, so the job falls
back to `<sha>~1..<sha>` rather than erroring or, worse, scanning nothing.

### The hook's exit-code contract — the hard-won part

`.githooks/pre-commit` blocks on **`EXIT_FOUND` (1) and nothing else**. Every
other status means *the guard did not answer*, and the hook says so and lets the
commit through, because the required CI check still refuses the merge.

| status | meaning | hook |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | clean | commit |
| `1` | names found | **REFUSE** |
| `2` | bad arguments — hook and guard drifted | warn, allow |
| `20` | guard raised, or a git call inside it failed | warn, allow |

⚠️ **This existed as one status until 2026-09-04, and it was worse than useless.**
`if ! out=$(run_guard)` collapsed every failure into "a real machine name",
so the hook told authors they had committed a hostname when it had merely
crashed. Measured twice that day, from two unrelated causes:

- a worktree whose `check_shapes.py` predated `--staged`, so argparse exited 2;
- **every** worktree on Windows, where `.git` is a file holding a Windows path
  WSL's git cannot follow — so `git` inside the WSL fallback exited 128 and the
  guard was inert in ~53 worktrees while working fine in the main clone. The
  hook now resolves the git dir natively and exports it across the boundary.

🔑 The rule this is an instance of, already written three times in this
directory: **a check whose result cannot distinguish "passed" from "never
answered" is not a check.** A guard that cries hostname when it means "I
crashed" is one somebody silences with `--no-verify`, and that removes the layer
permanently. `selftest.sh` asserts each status leads to its own outcome, and
asserts a **non-1** status specifically — "non-zero" would pass on the bug.

⚠️ The hook must be committed **mode 755**. Git skips a non-executable hook in
silence, which is layer 1 disarmed with nothing anywhere to say so; the selftest
checks this too.

## The six things that go wrong

**0. The `--replace-text` rules file has NO COMMENT SYNTAX.** `get_replace_text()`
treats **every** line as a literal to match, and when a line carries no `==>`
the replacement defaults to `***REMOVED***`. So a line containing just `#` means
*replace every `#` in every blob*. Measured 2026-09-06 on a rules file whose
first four lines were ordinary explanation: **548,700 blob lines rewritten**,
`CLAUDE.md` stripped of all 53 of its headings, `.gitattributes` turned into
`***REMOVED***!/bin/sh`. The only tell during the run is a burst of
`is not a valid attribute name: .gitattributes:N` warnings, buried in the
progress spam.

Keep the `.txt` pure rules; put prose in a sibling file. Assert it before
running:

```bash
grep -c ''  replace.txt        # every line is a rule -- is that how many you meant?
grep -vc '==>' replace.txt     # want 0: a line without ==> uses the REMOVED default
```

⚠️ The `--mailmap` file is a *different* format (git's own) and **does** support
`#` comments. The two files sharing a directory and not a syntax is exactly the
trap.

**0b. A verification must not contaminate what it verifies.** To diff the
pre- and post-rewrite trees it is tempting to fetch the old master into the
rewritten mirror. That works, and it also re-imports every pre-rewrite commit:
`git log --all` then reports the addresses as still present, and — far worse —
`git push --mirror` would have **published `refs/orig/master`**, re-uploading in
one step the exact history the rewrite existed to remove. Do the comparison in a
third, throwaway repo, and assert before pushing that the mirror holds nothing
outside `refs/heads/*` and `refs/tags/*`.

**1. `--replace-text` does NOT touch commit messages.** It rewrites blob
contents only; commit and annotated-tag messages are a separate surface behind
`--replace-message`, and filter-repo says nothing at all when you omit it. The
first run of this sweep reported success, left every blob clean, and left 745
real names in the commit log — which on this repo is the *richer* of the two
surfaces, because the field-test narratives live in commit bodies. Always
verify against `git log --all --format=%B`, never the tree alone.

**2. `residual: none` is the only success condition, and CASE IS THE TRAP.**
The residual scan re-reads everything case-INSENSITIVELY. The first pass of the
2026-08-28 sweep listed only uppercase spellings, reported success, and left 60
real tags in the tree because half the prose was lowercase.

⚠️ That exact mistake was then **rebuilt one file over**: `check_shapes.py`
shipped with uppercase-only patterns, and on 2026-09-04 a field log wrote two
asset tags in lowercase — the guard printed `none found`, CI went green, and
the names reached a public repo and 15 GitHub items. Everything here matches
case-insensitively now, and `selftest.sh` carries every canary in both casings
so the regression cannot come back quietly. People write a hostname however it
came out of their terminal; a check that assumes a casing is not a check.

**3. Longest key first, or you orphan a prefix.** A `DESKTOP-`/`LAPTOP-`
qualified form has to be rewritten before its bare tag, or the qualifier is
left stranded on an already-rewritten name. `load_map` sorts by key length and
every consumer iterates that one list, so the rule cannot be applied in one
place and forgotten in another.

**4. Whole-word matching is what makes short keys safe** — and it has to be
*verified*, not assumed. Before mapping a 3-letter shorthand, dump every blob
in history and read the contexts:

```bash
git cat-file --batch-all-objects --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname)' \
  | awk '$1=="blob"{print $2}' | git cat-file --batch \
  | grep -aoE '.{0,45}\b<KEY>\b.{0,35}' | sort -u
```

If any hit is a code identifier rather than prose, the key is not safe to map.

## Before rewriting history, know what it does and does not achieve

- **It does not remove anything from GitHub.** Old commits stay reachable by
  SHA through the `refs/pull/*` refs, effectively forever, unless GitHub
  Support runs GC on the repo. Drop those refs locally before filtering (you
  cannot push to them anyway) and treat the rewrite as cleaning what people
  *read*, not what a determined fetch can still reach.
- **Every SHA changes.** Clones elsewhere must re-clone or hard-reset; SHAs
  quoted in docs, issues and release notes dangle.
- **Back up first**: `git bundle create <path>.bundle --all` captures every ref
  in one file and restores with a plain `git clone`.
- Branches that exist only locally are not in a mirror clone and so are not
  rewritten. They keep the old content until deleted or rebuilt.

## Adding a name

Find the replacement, do not invent one. In order of authority: the
`agents.display_name` column in the product database; then the alias table
recorded in the earlier privacy commit (`git log --grep='role-based aliases'`),
which is where the existing generic host aliases come from; then, only if
neither has it, the next free slot in the series already in use.
