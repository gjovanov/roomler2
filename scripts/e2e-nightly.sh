# Nightly Playwright sweep against the standing `roomler-ai-e2e` stack.
#
# The suite has NO GitHub CI lane (it needs a full backend + Mailpit), and
# when it never runs it rots: the first manual sweep (2026-07-28) found two
# shipped auth bugs. This script keeps it honest from the build host.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Fast-forwards the repo clone (spec source of truth).
#   2. Points the e2e stack's roomler2 at the CURRENT PROD image tag (read
#      from the deploy repo's prod overlay) via `kubectl set image` — the
#      e2e namespace is deliberately NOT ArgoCD-managed.
#   3. Runs the browser as the `pwrunner` sidecar INSIDE the app pod.
#      ⚠️ The stack's ROOMLER__APP__FRONTEND_URL must equal the origin the
#      browser uses — here http://127.0.0.1, and a PORT is part of an Origin.
#      Since the session-cookie migration the /ws upgrade authenticates by
#      COOKIE and refuses an untrusted Origin with 403 (cookies are ambient
#      and a WS upgrade is not subject to CORS), which silently disarmed every
#      realtime spec for a week. Both live in the deploy repo's e2e overlay,
#      so they move together.
#   4. Copies the spec tree into that sidecar and runs the suite there (minus
#      e2e/video/ — that spec is bun-only syntax).
#   5. Diffs the failing specs against scripts/e2e-expected-failures.txt and
#      writes ~/e2e-nightly/LATEST (one summary line) + a dated full log.
#      Unexpected failures ⇒ exit 1 (and a GitHub issue, if `gh` is authed).
#
# Install (build host) — note BOTH details, each of which silently killed this
# lane once:
#   crontab: 30 3 * * * REPO=$HOME/wt-e2e-lane bash $HOME/wt-e2e-lane/scripts/e2e-nightly.sh >> $HOME/e2e-nightly/cron.log 2>&1
#   * invoked through `bash`, because this file was committed 100644 and the
#     bare-path form failed `Permission denied` EVERY night from install until
#     2026-08-29 — into a log nobody reads. The mode bit is fixed too, but the
#     cron line should not depend on it.
#   * REPO points at a dedicated worktree, never the shared clone: that clone
#     is routinely parked on another session's branch.

# ── 3. the browser is IN the pod ─────────────────────────────────────
# FR-37. There are no port-forwards any more, and that is the point.
#
# The old lane ran a browser on THIS host and reached the stack through
# `kubectl port-forward`, which forwards one TCP port and no media — and this
# host has no route to the pod network anyway (`ip route get <podIP>` leaves
# via the default route), so no RTP was ever going to arrive. Every conference
# spec failed for months and the baseline blamed unforwarded RTC ports.
#
# The browser now runs as the `pwrunner` sidecar inside the app pod, so:
#   * the app is `http://127.0.0.1`, which is a SECURE CONTEXT — a Service URL
#     is not, and `navigator.mediaDevices` is simply UNDEFINED there;
#   * mediasoup announces 127.0.0.1, so media has nowhere to get lost;
#   * the Origin matches `frontend_url`, so the cookie-authenticated /ws
#     upgrade is not refused (that 403 silently disarmed every realtime spec
#     for a week);
#   * the ~60 lines of self-healing port-forward supervisor this replaces are
#     gone, along with the failure mode where a forward stays alive while
#     forwarding nothing.
