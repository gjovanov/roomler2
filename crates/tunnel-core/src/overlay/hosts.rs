//! FR-72 P6 — the last rung of the MagicDNS ladder.
//!
//! The preferred path is the OS split-DNS steer (`dns::configure_os`): dynamic,
//! whole-zone, nothing written to disk. On some managed hosts it cannot work at
//! all — a corporate DNS-enforcement layer intercepts the machine's own DNS
//! egress and refuses queries to any non-approved resolver, **including the
//! host's own overlay address**. Field-measured: the same resolver, at the same
//! moment, answers a peer correctly and refuses its own host with `REFUSED`
//! (RA=0, which our resolver never emits — `dns.rs` always sets RA=1).
//!
//! The hosts file is not on the DNS path at all, which is exactly why it
//! survives that. This module owns a **delimited block** in it, so the file's
//! other lines — a corporate VPN's, an operator's — are preserved byte for byte.
//!
//! ⚠️ **FQDNs only, never bare labels.** Writing `mars` into a corporate
//! machine's hosts file would shadow a real internal host; only
//! `mars.<magic domain>` is ever written.
//!
//! ⚠️ **A stale entry is the hazard**, not the write. Overlay addresses are
//! recycled, so a line left behind by a hard exit can silently send traffic to
//! a different machine — the same class of bug as pooling an overlay address
//! before its tombstone. The block is therefore cleared when the ladder climbs
//! back to DNS, cleared on runtime teardown, and cleared at runtime start
//! before anything else (the boot reconciler: whatever a previous process left
//! is not trusted, it is removed and re-derived).
