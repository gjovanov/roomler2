//! Overlay node runtime (Phase 3b).
//!
//! Drives one node's membership in the overlay mesh: announces itself
//! (`rc:overlay.join`), applies the server's netmap (install / drop a
//! WireGuard peer per entry), brings up the TUN, and pumps packets
//! between the TUN and the [`WgDevice`](super::wg::WgDevice).
//!
//! The runtime **owns** the `WgDevice` and runs a single `select!` loop of
//! pure CONTROL work (netmap installs, carrier health sweeps, relay
//! coordination, route guard). The DATA PLANE is fully off-loop (P1/S6):
//! outbound rides the persistent TUN reader task → mpsc → the dedicated
//! outbound pump (a [`WgSender`](super::wg::WgSender) clone — the shared
//! send half of the device, single-writer/multi-reader); inbound rides the
//! per-peer recv tasks / shared demux → mpsc → the inbound writer task.
//! No control handler can therefore ever delay a packet; `warn_if_slow`
//! remains as the tripwire against re-coupling.
//!
//! Carrier construction (direct UDP vs coturn relay) is delegated to a
//! [`LinkFactory`] so this orchestration is testable with loopback
//! carriers + a mock TUN, and so the corp-NAT relay path can be added
//! without reworking the runtime.
