//! HW-downscale Phase A — the CPU resampler, extracted from peer.rs and
//! de-wasted.
//!
//! Field data (2026-08-21, corplap-3 h264_qsv + WINHOST-A hevc_qsv): the
//! Smoother rung's native→1024×640 downscale measured **26-45 ms/frame**
//! against a 3-8 ms hardware encode — and since P8a-2 the rung engages
//! only DURING motion, so the bill lands at the worst moment. The
//! algorithm's own cost model predicts 9-17 ms for that rung; the rest
//! was implementation waste, each piece individually removable:
//!
//! - the Lanczos tap tables were rebuilt EVERY frame (~1,664 inner Vec
//!   allocations + ~36k `sinf` calls for a pure function of the dims);
//! - the 9.8-13 MB i16 intermediate was freshly allocated AND zeroed per
//!   frame (every element is overwritten before it is read);
//! - the alpha lane was resampled through both passes and then discarded
//!   by every consumer (dcv BGRA→NV12/I444 ignores A) — 25 % dead MACs.
//!
//! [`Resampler`] owns the cached taps (flattened: one weights vec + a
//! `(start, len)` index — no per-column Vecs) and the pooled intermediate;
//! one instance per pump, like `RateGovernor`. The destination buffer is
//! deliberately NOT pooled — it moves into an `Arc<Frame>` that
//! `last_good_frame`/the encoder/the send path may hold arbitrarily long.
//!
//! `ROOMLERD_SCALE_THREADS` (config key `scale_threads`, default
//! `min(available_parallelism, 4)` since FR-65 — it was 1) row-bands both
//! passes across N scoped threads — both are embarrassingly parallel, and on
//! HW-encode hosts the cores are idle during motion. It shipped as "a lever
//! for the field, not a policy", and the field then measured what leaving it
//! off costs: `avg_scale_ms = 23.6` on a constrained CORPLAP-1 session, and
//! 18.15 → 5.91 ms/frame going 1 → 4 threads in the bench. It is now policy.
//!
//! Phase B (GPU scale before readback, D3D11 VideoProcessor) makes this
//! whole module the FALLBACK on Windows GPU-capture backends; this stays
//! the primary path for GDI/scrap-class capture and non-Windows.
