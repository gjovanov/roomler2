//! P3 (Parsec-class plan) — transport/codec-aware rate-profile helpers for
//! the DC video pumps. Pure (no ffmpeg/webrtc/tokio types, explicit
//! `Instant`s), so everything here unit-tests on the default feature build
//! even though the callers are `ffmpeg-encoder`-gated.
//!
//! Three concerns live here:
//!
//! 1. **Persisted-flip rebuild** ([`FlipTracker`]): a mid-session
//!    relay↔direct ICE renomination already re-clamps the AIMD ceiling
//!    LIVE, but the encoder's fps/bufsize and the capture pacer were baked
//!    at pump start — a session that STARTED on the relay stayed at 30 fps
//!    forever after upgrading to direct (peer.rs pump-start
//!    `ffmpeg_target_fps(constrained)` + `capture::open_default`). The
//!    tracker decides when a flip has persisted long enough to be worth a
//!    full encoder rebuild + capture reopen (each costs an IDR + a brief
//!    hiccup, so: 2 consecutive 5 s checks to debounce ICE flapping, and at
//!    most one rebuild per 60 s — the rc.217 "recovery that re-triggers its
//!    own trigger needs a cooldown" lesson applied from day one).
//!
//! 2. **Codec rate factor** ([`codec_rate_factor_pct`]): the maxrate
//!    ceiling was codec-agnostic (0.07 bpp/s for everyone), but H.264
//!    needs ~1.5× the bits of HEVC/AV1 for the same screen-content text
//!    sharpness. Field 2026-07-26 (P2 rollout, WINHOST-A/WINHOST-H/WINHOST-B):
//!    H.264-DC motion "very smooth" but "text gets blurred from time to
//!    time" — transients exhausting the HEVC-sized budget. H.264 gets a
//!    150% ceiling; the relay clamp still applies AFTER the factor (pipe
//!    physics don't care which codec fills them).
//!
//! 3. **H.264 CQ adjustment** ([`h264_cq_adjust`]): at equal nominal
//!    quality numbers H.264 codes text visibly softer than HEVC (different
//!    QP scale + weaker intra prediction). The h264_* encoders get a
//!    2-step sharper constant-quality target off the shared `FFMPEG_CQ`
//!    base (env still wins as the base; the adjustment is relative).
//!
//! 4. **Idle-settle keyframe gate** ([`SettleKeyframeGate`]): the rc.187
//!    settle IDR, burst-gated so caret blinks stop metronoming forced IDRs.
//!
//! 5. **Scale-aware CQ bias** ([`scale_cq_bias`], P7): deep resolution
//!    rungs run far below the [3, 12] Mbps maxrate floor's bpp budget —
//!    spend the headroom on text sharpness instead of leaving it unused.
//!
//! 6. **Idle native-rung refinement** ([`IdleRefine`], P7): when the ONLY
//!    reason the encode is below native is a resolution cap and the scene
//!    has settled, lift the cap so the encoder rebuilds at native and ships
//!    one crisp still; the first motion burst restores the cap in ~300 ms.
