//! P8b — the encode-policy module (item 2 of the P8 capture-truth
//! program): ONE place that decides the encode rung and the rate
//! ceiling, so the media pumps become executors.
//!
//! Why this exists (field history): every crisp-text investigation this
//! quarter ultimately needed the answer to "why is the stream at
//! 1024×640 right now?", and the answer was scattered across ~120 pump
//! lines that composed caps in one order on the frame path and a
//! *different* order in the idle-refine eligibility hook — which is how
//! the P7b mixed-dial bug shipped (the hook read the owner's dial while
//! the frame path applied the merged one). Both call sites now consume
//! the SAME [`plan_dims`] result, and the winning constraint is named
//! in [`DimsPlan::reason`] so the rung-change log finally explains
//! itself.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT here (yet): keyframe policy and fps/skip decisions
//! (event-driven, stage 2 of this item per the approved plan), and the
//! vp9 pump's bitrate formula (a real divergence — 0.20 bpp/s × quality
//! dial vs this module's 0.25 direct / 0.07 relay bpp/s × codec/chroma factors — kept
//! visible as "vp9 doesn't call [`rate_plan`]" instead of papered over).
//!
//! Everything here is pure over its inputs (the P5 merges and the
//! refine state are INPUTS, not lookups), so the whole decision table
//! unit-tests on the default build.
