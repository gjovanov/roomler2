//! Post-install watcher subprocess.
//!
//! Spawned by the updater immediately before the agent exits to make
//! room for the installer. Tracks the installer process by PID,
//! captures its exit code, then verifies that the new binary on
//! disk reports the expected version. Writes a typed outcome JSON
//! to `<log_dir>/last-install.json` so an operator (or the next
//! startup of the agent) can read what actually happened.
//!
//! ## Why a separate process
//!
//! The agent's own EXE is about to be overwritten by msiexec /
//! dpkg / installer(8). We can't sit in the same process and wait
//! for that to finish, because:
//!   1. Windows MSI on a running EXE either fails outright with
//!      `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` or schedules the rename for next
//!      reboot — neither of which is the intent.
//!   2. The exit-and-let-the-supervisor-relaunch flow that the
//!      Scheduled Task / systemd / launchd model relies on means
//!      the parent agent process IS exiting; there's no one home
//!      to call back into when the installer finishes.
//!
//! The watcher's binary image is mapped before the installer ran;
//! the file at the same path on disk is then overwritten by the
//! installer, but the watcher's mapped pages stay valid for the
//! lifetime of the process. When the watcher exits, the new
//! binary's pages are what subsequent invocations load.
//!
//! ## Why the watcher runs from a staged COPY on Windows
//!
//! Mapped pages survive the overwrite, but Windows Installer's
//! RestartManager doesn't care about pages — it enumerates the
//! *processes holding the files being replaced* and shuts down the
//! ones whose SID it can manage. A watcher spawned from
//! `<install>\roomlerd.exe` IS such a process, so RM killed it
//! seconds into every install that had contended files (field
//! forensic 2026-08-21 on the dev host: `last-install.json` frozen
//! at `InProgress`, watcher born 02:54:11, RM app-shutdown
//! 02:54:12) — the wedge-recovery and service-start safety nets
//! below never ran on exactly the installs that needed them. The
//! updater therefore copies the EXE into the update staging dir and
//! spawns the watcher from the copy (`updater::stage_watcher_exe`),
//! passing `--origin-exe <install-dir exe>` so flavour
//! classification and the version probe still target the real
//! install rather than the copy's %TEMP% location (which would
//! misclassify as PerUser — same trap as the install wizard,
//! see `spawn_installer_inner`'s doc).
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. Updater downloads installer.
//! 2. Updater spawns msiexec / dpkg / installer(8) as a child.
//! 3. Updater spawns `roomlerd post-install-watch
//!    --installer-pid <pid> --installer-path <path>
//!    --expected-version <tag>` — on Windows from a staged COPY of
//!    the EXE with `--origin-exe <install-dir exe>` appended (see
//!    "Why the watcher runs from a staged COPY" above).
//! 4. Updater exits the parent agent so the OS releases its EXE
//!    file lock.
//! 5. Watcher polls the installer PID until it exits or 10 min
//!    elapses. **Windows wedge recovery**: on timeout the watcher
//!    kills the wedged msiexec (plus any leftover msiexec worker
//!    holding the machine-wide `_MSIExecute` mutex) and re-runs the
//!    staged installer ONCE — the exact manual recovery that worked
//!    3/3 in the field (rc.226/rc.228/rc.232 self-update wedges).
//! 6. Watcher waits 2 s for the FS to settle, runs `<own-path>
//!    --version`, compares against the expected tag. Windows: when
//!    the own-path probe can't verify (P4b renamed the install
//!    folder, so a rename-hop watcher runs from the vacated dir),
//!    it falls back to probing `…\Roomler\roomlerd.exe` for the
//!    running flavour.
//! 7. Watcher writes `last-install.json` and exits. Windows
//!    perMachine: as a last act the watcher runs `sc start` on the
//!    SCM service — every observed wedge left the service STOPPED
//!    (the MSI never reached StartServices), and a host that stays
//!    down is worse than any install verdict. The supervisor
//!    relaunches the agent on next logon (Win Scheduled Task) or
//!    immediately (systemd / launchd). The new binary then reads
//!    `last-install.json` at startup to surface the outcome.
//!
//! ## What this is NOT
//!
//! - It does NOT roll back failed installs. That's Phase 6.3's job
//!   (last-known-good rollback) — this watcher just records what
//!   happened.
//! - It does NOT verify install signatures. The MSI's Authenticode
//!   chain is checked by the OS at install time; we trust that.
