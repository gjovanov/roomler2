//! Thin wrapper around a `webrtc-rs` `RTCPeerConnection`.
//!
//! Owns the per-session WebRTC state: codecs, ICE, data channels, and (when
//! a capture/encoder backend is compiled in) a video track that's fed from
//! a spawned media pump task.
//!
//! Media pump lifecycle:
//!   1. On new(): add an `H264` track and spawn the pump.
//!   2. The pump asks `capture::open_default` for frames; if the build
//!      doesn't include `scrap-capture`, it gets a NoopCapture and never
//!      emits anything — track is added but carries no samples. The
//!      browser still negotiates the m=video section.
//!   3. On each frame, `encode::open_default` produces H.264 NALUs that
//!      become a `webrtc::media::Sample`. Sample duration is derived from
//!      the capture rate.
//!   4. On close(): cancels the pump, closes the PC.
